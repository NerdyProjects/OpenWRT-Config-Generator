# OpenWRT-Config-Generator

This script generates a set of wifi configurations for OpenWRT access points.
It is meant to quickly configure a set of access points, especially when configuring 802.11r (fast roaming) and a list of all BSSIDs is needed in all configurations.

It is more a proof of concept but working for the specific kanthaus setup.
You might need to adjust it for other configuration options or features.
